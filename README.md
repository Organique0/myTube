This is a disaster and I don't know how to fix it because I am only good at following tutorials and suck at actual programming. 
Sorry. 
Maybe I will fix this when I actually know how to code. 
Typescript is cancer and I hate it but I want to learn it because it is the best language to master for web development.
And I know that TypeScript is meant to make your code better, but having to figure out what types to use where is actually very hard.
Yes, I could just use PHP and SQL to build a server but that is so 1990. 
And I actually am pretty decent with PHP and SQL.
Real programmers use Javascript and MongoDB now. 
Yes, I know that there are so many different server frameworks that use different languages that I might like more like Python and Go but as I have already said - TypeScript is cooler even tho I hate it so much. I mean, I have never seen a worse language than this. It is so messy and ugly (unlike pyhon and go). 
And I have to say, Node.js is actually pretty amazing. Mostly because of NPM that just auto installs all of the needed dependencis.
And there are hundreds of cool libraries nowadays that make development super easy but the problem is that you still have to learn them.
And of course there is Next.js that I still don't even know why is it used exactly but everyone says that it is amazing and you should use it with React.
And on the topic of React.js. I think that it is pretty cool and not even that hard to learn but still. For my needs I could just use vanilla Javascript.
But as I have said, vanilla Javascript is lame AF. 
Who even uses that boring barbage nowadays what there are so many cooler frontend frameworks that allow you to make amazing applications with very little code.
And yes, there is Vue.js that exists too, but React is the most popular and since I do what everyone else does I want to learn React.js
